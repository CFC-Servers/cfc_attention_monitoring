# cfc_attention_monitoring
 this addon displays a icon above the head of players that are currently tabbed out of the game.

# how it works
  It sends the player that tabbed out to the server to be put in a table of tabbed out players
  then after some delay it will send the table back to the client where it will render out the 
  icons.
