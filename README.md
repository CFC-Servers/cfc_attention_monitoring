# cfc_attention_monitoring
A simple player status display, shows if the player is in the mainmenu, spawnmenu, tabbed out or chat using icons above their head. Optimised to respect PVS so it's compatible with larger servers.
Time will be displayed under the icon if the player has been in a certain status for more than 60s.
